# Understanding Version Control: `4.13.1`

Version numbers usually follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** with the format:


## Breakdown of `4.13.1`

- **4 → MAJOR**
  - Big changes.
  - May introduce **breaking changes** (not backward compatible).
  - Example: Moving from `3.x` to `4.0.0` could break older code.

- **13 → MINOR**
  - New **features** added.
  - **Backward compatible** with previous versions in the same major.
  - Example: `4.12.0` → `4.13.0` means new functionality but old code still works.

- **1 → PATCH**
  - Small **bug fixes** or improvements.
  - No new features, no breaking changes.
  - Example: `4.13.0` → `4.13.1` means a bug or issue was fixed.



## Extra: Pre-release Tags

Sometimes you’ll see suffixes like:

- `4.13.1-beta` → Beta version (for testing, unstable).  
- `4.13.1-rc` → Release Candidate (almost final, may become stable).  
- `4.13.1-alpha` → Early experimental version.  


# The Caret (^) in Versioning

In `package.json`, the **caret (^)** is used to allow automatic updates to newer versions, but **only within the same MAJOR version**.

---

## Example: `^4.13.1`

- This means:  
  - Minimum version: `4.13.1`  
  - Maximum version: **anything below 5.0.0**  

So it will accept:
- `4.13.2`, `4.14.0`, `4.99.99`  
- **But NOT `5.0.0`** (because that’s a breaking change).

---

## Why?

- MAJOR updates (`5.0.0`) might break your app.  
- MINOR (`4.14.0`) and PATCH (`4.13.2`) are **safe to upgrade** since they should stay backward-compatible.

---

## Contrast with Tilde (~)

- `~4.13.1` → Only allows **PATCH** updates.  
  - Accepts: `4.13.2`, `4.13.9`  
  - Not `4.14.0`.
